## web application for the classification of suicidal texts in Spanish language
This is a prototype of a simple web application to classify suicidal texts in Spanish language, it has language limitations because it is translated from English, so you cannot use linguistic customs (To see all the restrictions, open the Webapp guide file).

## Requisites
* python installed
* IDE installed (i recommend visual studio code)
